Already knowing one solution to the second-order DE:
$$
L[y]=y''+p(x)y'+q(x)y=0
$$

We can always find a second solution, [[1-Recent/Academics/MATH/Differential Equations/Linear Dependence\|linearly independent]] to the first, by assuming the second solution is of the form 
$$
y_{2}(x)=v(x)y_{1}(x)
$$
where $v(x)$ is some unknown function of the independent variable
