# Polynomial Regression
Create new predictor variables by taking powers of our original predictor variables, $X^k\to$ kth order polynomial form
- if we have data of the form $(X,Y)$, we can make a new predictor variable $X_{2}=X^2$, a quadratic variable of the original $X_{1}=X$
- new form of the data as $(Y,X,X^2)=(Y,X_{1},X_{2})$
