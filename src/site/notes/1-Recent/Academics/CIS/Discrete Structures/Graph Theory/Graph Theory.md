let $G=(V,E)$ be a graph
# Graph
- Graph $G=(V,E)$
	- an ordered pair of sets in which the elements of $E$ are 2-element subsets of V
		- $G=(\{1,2,3,4,5\},\{\{1,2\},\{1,3\},\{1,4\},\{2,3\},\{3,4\},\{3,5\}\})$
		- $V(G)$ = vertex-set
			- $V(G)=\{1,2,3,4,5\}$
		- $E(G)$ = edge-set
			- $E(G)=\{\{1,2\},\{1,3\},\{1,4\},\{2,3\},\{3,4\},\{3,5\}\}$
