A graph that has an Euler Tour
# Euler Tour
A [[1-Recent/Academics/CIS/Discrete Structures/Graph Theory/Graph Walks#Walks\|walk]] which traverses every edge in a graph exactly once
- A graph has an Euler Tour $\iff$ 
	- it is [[1-Recent/Academics/CIS/Discrete Structures/Graph Theory/Graph Properties#Reachability\|connected]]
	- has no vertices of degree 0
	- has at most 2 degrees of odd degree
