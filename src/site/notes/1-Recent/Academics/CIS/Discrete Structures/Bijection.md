# Proof by Bijection
- functions properties
	- let $f:{A}\longrightarrow{B}$ be a function from set A to B
	- surjective if
		- $\forall b\in B, \exists a \in A$ such that $f(a)=b$
	- injective if
		- $\forall a,a' \in A$ if $f(a)=f(a'),$ then $a=a'$
	- bijective if it is both surjective and injective
