A [[Academics/CIS/Discrete Structures/Graph Theory/Graph Theory\|graph]] that has a Hamiltonian Cycle
- if it instead has a hamiltonian path it is called a weakly hamiltonian path
# Hamiltonian Cycle
A [[Academics/CIS/Discrete Structures/Graph Theory/Graph Walks#Cycles\|cycle]] which visits every vertex in a graph exactly once
# Hamiltonian Path
A [[Academics/CIS/Discrete Structures/Graph Theory/Graph Walks#Path\|path]] that visits every vertex in a graph exactly once
