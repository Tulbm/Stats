## Boolean Algebra
- binary algebra
- operations
	- • = multiplication
		- 0 • 1 = 0
		- 0 • 0 = 0
		- 1 • 1 = 1
	- + = addition
		- 1 + 1 = 1
		- 1 + 0 = 1
	- complement (reversion)
		- ![](https://i.imgur.com/4IxHZvf.png)
	- = –> used to denotate logical equivalence
		- ![](https://i.imgur.com/6zWVIch.png)
			- ![](https://i.imgur.com/Gj5XY2j.png)
			- de morgan's law can be used to eliminate addition operations
	- is functionally complete if any Boolean function can be expressed using only operations from the set.
		- set {addition, multiplication, complement}
- order of operations

## Boolean Functions
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/UWHorRE.png)
- boolean expressions
	- ![](https://i.imgur.com/4LS25Ze.png)
	- going from output to function
		- ![](https://i.imgur.com/vhLSPVx.png)
		- the result from the function is an example of a boolean expression
- duality principle
	- ![](https://i.imgur.com/RqCqGG5.png)
- literal
	- a Boolean variable or the complement of a Boolean variable (for example, x or x).
		- ![](https://i.imgur.com/06u5Eoy.png)
- minterm
	- the product of n literals, with exactly one literal per variable.
	- can't repeat the variables
	- In a Boolean function whose input variables are v1, v2,...,vk, a minterm is a product of literals u1u2...uk such that each uj is either vj or v`j
		- x`yz and xy`z are examples of minterms for a Boolean function with input variables x, y, and z. However, yz is not a minterm because variable x is missing from the term.
- maxterm
	- the sum of n literals, with exactly one literal per variable
	- can't repeat the varibles

## Disjunctive/Conjunctive Normal Forms
- just to standardadize
- disjunctive normal form (DNF)
	- if x +(or) y +(or) z are true = true
	- a sum of products of literals
		- ![](https://i.imgur.com/sALgYk5.png)
		- In a DNF expression, multiplication can only be applied to literals
		- A term in a DNF expression can be a single literal
			- ![](https://i.imgur.com/IWr5DjK.png)
		- more than one expression can correspond to the same function
			- ![](https://i.imgur.com/mnf73Lg.png)
- conjunctive normal form (CNF)
	- if a x(and) b x(and) c are true -> true
	- a product of sums of literals
		- ![](https://i.imgur.com/KRI3I1d.png)
	- each term in the product that is a sum of literals is called a clause
		- ![](https://i.imgur.com/2bXCWt5.png)
	- addition can only be applied to literals
	- can not contain an expression of the form xy + z because xy is not a literal.

## Functional Completeness
- A set of operations is functionally complete if any Boolean function can be expressed using only operations from the set
	- set {addition, multiplication, complement}
- if addition/multiplication is hard to implement in the hardware, we can express the function using only 
	- 1- set {multiplication, complement}
	- 2- set {addition, complement}
	- can't have one with complement tho(x' cant be computed)
	- through De Morgan's law
		- ![](https://i.imgur.com/MbVg9e3.png)
		- ![](https://i.imgur.com/8UCd8nY.png)
		- (taking out the + or x)
		- while still having the function be complete
- NAND/NOR are functionally complete, while only being one operation
	- NAND = not and, symbol ↑.
		- ![](https://i.imgur.com/XQtScZj.png)
		- getting complement
			- ![](https://i.imgur.com/FNc5cPn.png)
			- ![](https://i.imgur.com/1uzgU6j.png)
	- NOR = not or, symbol ↓.
		- ![](https://i.imgur.com/fWEY8lq.png)
		- (x↓y)' = x + y
		- a' = a↓a
		- getting complement
			- 0↓0 = 1
			- 1↓1 = 0
			- x↓x = x'
			- x + y = (x↓y)↓(x↓y)
## Boolean Satisfiability
- The Boolean satisfiability problem (called SAT for short)
	- can be used on a bunch of subjects, where you only need to find one solution
		- schedule of classes (where they conflict with each other) -> only need to find one possible schedule, and when its in a university level, needs an algorithm to solve it
			- an algorithm that only evaluates to 1 when the variables correspond to a valid schedule with no conflicts
- if an expression never evaluates to 1, with any input variables -> unsatisfiable
	- if theres at least 1 set of inputs that evaluate to 1, its satisfiable
	- ![](https://i.imgur.com/lDFmhUR.png)
- in DNF form ( xyz + yz + xzz')
	- The formula is satisfiable if and only if there is a term that does not contain a variable and its negation
		- ![](https://i.imgur.com/RXSeoEb.png)
			- theres not second w,x,y or z with a '
- in CNF form ((x+y+z)(x+z))
	- all the clauses () have to be satisfied, not only one like in the DNF (much more difficult to prove)
		- ![](https://i.imgur.com/IJsRNur.png)
- making an expression to model the scheduling problem
	- CNF that checks if all classes are present and if no conflicts happen
		- ![](https://i.imgur.com/JJXJsAR.png)
	- ![](https://i.imgur.com/uBwV2lc.png)
		- first term gives false if class B is not assigned
		- second term gives false if class b is assigned to both periods
	- ![](https://i.imgur.com/EKPa8D6.png)
		- if B and E are assigned to the same period -> false
## Gates and Circuits
- circuits used in eletronic devices are built from eletrical devices called gates.
- gates receives x boolean input values and gives an output based on that
	- gates = implement a simple boolean function
		- ![](https://i.imgur.com/GiBoFcZ.png)
	- AND gate = multiplication
		- ![](https://i.imgur.com/7008jma.png)
	- OR gate = addition
		- ![](https://i.imgur.com/pSLpJCc.png)
	- inverter = complement
		- ![](https://i.imgur.com/M9sRp5j.png)
	- classes of circuits
		- combinatorial
			- can't store information over time
			- computes a boolean function
				- can find a boolean expression from it 
					- ![](https://i.imgur.com/lascFgy.png)
				- and vice-versa
					- ![](https://i.imgur.com/tokexhJ.png)
	- designing circuits
		- 1- build input/output table with desired output for each combination of inputs
		- 2- write boolean expression for the table's function
		- 3- construct the digital circuit
			- not the most efficient circuit most of the times
