a connected [[Academics/CIS/Discrete Structures/Graph Theory/Graph Theory\|graph]] with no cycles
- all vertices have a possible path between them
- a tree $G=(V,E)$ with $|V|\geq 2$ must have at least 2 vertices with degree 1 (leaf)
	- proof: need 2 dead-ends otherwise the tree will have a cycle
- $|E|=|V|-1$
# Forest
- a graph with no cycles
- each component of a forest is a tree
# Leaf
- a vertex of degree one
- the end of each branch of the tree
# Binary tree
- a tree where each vertex has degree at most 3
- balanced binary tree is a tree where the height of any two vertices is not different by more than 1
	- height = length from root to leaf
