- a statement in logic always has a well defined meaning
	- can't be ambiguous like in spoken languages
	- used in many fields to make precise statements
		- law, medicine
		- math to prove theorems
		- cs for automated reasoning and in designing digital circuits
## Propositional/Logical operations
- differences z/l
	- zybook = logical operation, compound proposition
	- lectures = propositional operation, propositional expression
- A proposition is a statement that is either true or false.
	- the most basic element in logic
	- can't be questions or commands
- **truth value**
	- indicates whether the proposition is true or false
	- truth value doesnt change a proposition being a preposition 
		- even if truth value is a matter of opinion or unknown
- truth table
	- ![](https://i.imgur.com/OdCKWZ1.png)

- compound proposition(propositional expression)
	- created by connecting individual propositions with logical(propositional) operations
		- ^ = conjunction operation
			- p ^ q = p and q (conjunction of p and q)
				- p ^ q: january has 31 days and february has 33 days
					- this compound preposition is false because q is false
			- works just like x in b. algebra, or intersection in math
				- p x q -> only true if p and q are true
		- v = disjunction operation
			- p v q = p or q (disjunction of p and q)
				- p v q: january has 31 days or february has 33 days
					- this compound preposition is true because p is true
			- works just like + in b. algebra, or union in math
				- p + q -> true if any of them are true
			- inclusive or = v
				- the most common, so we just call it or, and have a symbol for it(v)
		- ⊕ = exclusive or
			- our language or
				- Lucy is going to the park or the movie
					- for us its either one or the other
					- so an exclusive or would not be true if both were true
		- ¬ = negation operation
			- ¬p = not p
			- the same as complement/bar in b. algebra
- propositional variables(such as p, q, r) can be used to denote arbitrary propositions
	- p: january has 31 days
	- q: february has 33 days
- expressing conjunctions in english
	- p and h
	- p, but h
	- despite the fact that p, h
	- although p, h
- standard for making tables

## Logical equivalence
- this is zybook's definitions
- A compound proposition is a tautology if the proposition is always true
	- p v p'
	- when not a tautology = easy to prove
	- (p ^ q) -> p is a tautology
		- if q is F, then F -> T
			- which is true, like if 5 is even then 6 is even
			- you cant give a counterexample to it
- A compound proposition is a contradiction if the proposition is always false
	- p ^ p'
	- when not a contradiction = easy to prove
- Two compound propositions are logically equivalent if they have the same truth value regardless of the truth values of their individual propositions
	- ![](https://i.imgur.com/GGGZXXt.png)
	- symbol = ≡
- de morgan's laws in propositions
	- ¬(p ∨ q)   ≡   (¬p ∧ ¬q)
		- It is not true that the patient has migraines or high blood pressure.  
		- The patient does not have migraines and does not have high blood pressure.
	- ¬(p ∧ q)   ≡   (¬p ∨ ¬q)
		- It is not true that the patient has migraines and high blood pressure.
		- The patient does not have migraines or does not have high blood pressure.

## Conditional Statements
- conditional operation
	- symbol ->
	- p -> q = if p then q
		- only false if p = true and q = false
			- the only way for a conditional statement to be false is if the hypothesis is true and the conclusion is false
		- p = hypothesis (antecedent in lectures)
		- q = conclusion (consequent in lectures)
- conditional proposition
	- a compound proposition that uses an ->
	- or conditional statement in english
		- ![](https://i.imgur.com/5VSM8B6.png)
		- only if =/= if and only if
- converse, contrapositive, inverse
	- ![](https://i.imgur.com/pxgIjYl.png)
	- converse
		- of p → q is q → p
	- contrapositive
		- of p → q is ¬q → ¬p
	- inverse
		- of p → q is ¬p → ¬q
- biconditional operation
	- if and only if
		- or iff, "p is necessary and sufficient for q" or "if p then q, and conversely"
	- p ↔ q
		- same things as p -> q ^ q -> p
	- only true when p/q are T/T or F/F
- order of operations
	- with no ( ), v/^and ¬ should be applied before → or ↔.
- laws of propositional logic are the same ones from b. algebra

## Predicates and quantifiers
- predicates
	- A logical statement whose truth value is a function of one or more variables
	- P(x) is not a proposition until we know what x is
		- the x in P(x) is called a free variable
			- it can take any value
		- doesnt matter if all values of x are true in the predicate
			- it still contains a variable
	- the domain(universe in lectures) of a variable is the set of all possible values for the variable
		- If the domain of a variable in a predicate is not clear from context, the domain should be given as part of the definition of the predicate.
			- obvious = "x ia an odd number" -> domain would likely be the set of all integers
- universal quantifier
	- ∀ (for all)
	- ∀x P(x) = "for all x, P(x)" or "for every x, P(x)"
		- ![](https://i.imgur.com/SYCZ1QV.png)
		- as all P(x) are true, their ^ will always be true
		- counterexample = any element from the domain where the predicate is false
			- if domain is empty, then ∀x P(x) is true because there are no counterexamples in the domain
- existential quantifier
	- ∃ (there exists)
	- ∃x P(x) = "There exists an x, such that P(x)"
		- ![](https://i.imgur.com/tTn7s2W.png)
		- as theres at least one P(x) true, their v (union) will always be true
		- only needs one example to be true
		- counterexample = needs to show that all elements of the domain will be false in the predicate
			- need to show that an arbitrary element(variable) from the domain is false
			- if the domain is empty, ∃x P(x) is false because there are no examples where its true
- quantified statements
	- A logical statement that includes a universal or existential quantifier
	- The quantifiers ∀ and ∃ are applied before the logical operations (higher precedence than ∧, ∨, →, and ↔) used for propositions.
		- ∀x P(x) ∧ Q(x) = (∀x P(x)) ∧ Q(x) 
			- as opposed to ∀x (P(x) ∧ Q(x)). 
	- the variables in ∀xP(x) and ∃xP(x) are bound variables
		- they are bound to the quantifier, can't change their value
			- unlike the x in P(x), which can change its value and turn the predicate into a proposition
		- In the statement (∀x P(x)) ∧ Q(x), the variable x in P(x) is bound by the universal quantifier, but the variable x in Q(x) is not bound by the universal quantifier.
			- so the statement (∀x P(x)) ∧ Q(x) is not a proposition.
			- in ∀x (P(x) ∧ Q(x)), ∀ binds both  variables, therefore its a proposition
	- Two quantified statements have the same logical meaning if they have the same truth value regardless of value of the predicates for the elements in the domain.
		- "Someone was sick and came to the party" is not the same as ∃x (S(x) ∨ P(x))
			- its just ∃x (S(x) ^ P(x)), idk why it doesnt just say it in the zybook
	- De Morgan's law
		- ¬∀x F(x) ≡ ∃x ¬F(x)
			- ¬∀x (P(x) ^ Q(x)) ≡ ∃x (¬P(x) v ¬Q(x)) 
		- ¬∃x P(x) ≡ ∀x ¬P(x)
			- ¬∃x (P(x) -> Q(x)) ≡ ∀x (P(x) ^ ¬Q(x)) 
- nested quantifiers
	- A logical expression with more than one quantifier that binds different variables in the same predicate
	- The logical expression is a proposition if all the variables are bound.
		- bound variables = variables with ∀ and ∃
	- multiple quantifiers
		- basically are just multiplying themselves
		- ∀x ∀y M(x, y)
			- M(x, y): x sent an email to y
			- ∀x ∀y M(x, y) ↔ "Everyone sent an email to everyone."
		- ∃x ∃y M(x, y)
			- ∃x ∃y M(x, y) ↔ "There is a person who sent an email to someone."\
		- ∃x ∀y M(x, y) 
			- ∃x ∀y M(x, y) ↔ "There is a person who sent an email to everyone."
		- ∀x ∃y M(x, y)
			- ∀x ∃y M(x, y) ↔ "Every person sent an email to someone."
		- two player game
			- used when ∀ and ∃ mix
			- two players compete to set the statement's truth value.
				- one is the existential, other the universal
				- ![](https://i.imgur.com/rExxZb4.png)
		- De Morgan's Law with them
			- Each time the negation sign moves past a quantifier, the quantifier changes type from universal to existential or from existential to universal
			- ![](https://i.imgur.com/jVhsqOO.png)
			- ¬∃x ∀y L(x, y )   ↔   There is no student who likes everyone in the school.
				- ∀x ∃y ¬L(x, y )   ↔   Every student in the school has someone that they do not like.
	- expressing "everyone else"
		- (x ≠ y) → M(x, y)
			- in order to a person to not email themselves
			- ∀x ∀y ((x ≠ y) → M(x, y))
	- expressing uniqueness
		- ∃x L(x) can be one or more possibilities
		- ![](https://i.imgur.com/kUskYcN.png)
	- moving quantifiers
		- ∀x (A(x) → ∃y M(x, y)) ≡ ∀x ∃y(A(x) → M(x, y))
			- the quantified variables need to be distinct
			- ∃y ∀x(A(x) → M(x, y)) could potentially change the meaning (going over another quantifier)
