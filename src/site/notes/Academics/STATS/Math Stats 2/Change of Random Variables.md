Regarding a random variable $Y$ that is a function of $X_{i}'s$
$$
Y=h(X_{1},\dots,X_{n})
$$
There are different techniques to find the pdf of $Y$
# [[Academics/STATS/Math Stats 2/Distribution function technique\|Distribution function technique]]

# [[Academics/STATS/Math Stats 2/Transformation technique\|Transformation technique]]
- can solve more complex problems
- for continuous random variables only

# Moment generating function technique
- derived case by case
