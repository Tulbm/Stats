## Coefficient of Determination
- $R^{2}=\frac{\text{Sample variance of}\hat{Y}}{\text{Sample variance of}Y}=\frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n}(\hat{Y}_{i}-\bar{Y})^{2}}{\sum_{i=1}^{n}(Y_{i}-\bar{Y})^{2}}$
	- $0\leq R^2\leq 1$
- the proportion of the total variance in Y that can be attributed to the linear relationship with X
- for simple linear regression models, $R^2=r^2$
