# Direct Integration
DEs in the form $y'(t)=g(t)$ don't require any special techniques outside of integration

We integrate both sides with respect to the independent variable and get
$$
y(t)=\int g(t) dt
$$
For higher derivatives, we integrate repeatedly
$$
\frac{d^ny}{dt^n}=f(t), \ \forall n>0
$$
