In multivariable functions $f(x_{1}(t),x_{2}(t)\dots x_{n}(t),t)$, the total derivative $\frac{df}{dt}$ with respect to one of the variables (t here) is:
$$
\frac{df}{dt}=\frac{\partial f}{\partial x_1}\frac{dx_1}{dt}+\frac{\partial f}{\partial x_2}\frac{dx_2}{dt}+\ldots+\frac{\partial f}{\partial x_n}\frac{dx_n}{dt}+\frac{\partial f}{\partial  t}
$$
