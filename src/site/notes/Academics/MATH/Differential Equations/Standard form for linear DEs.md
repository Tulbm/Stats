# Standard form for linear DEs
$$
y^{(n)}(t)+f_{n-1}(t)y^{(n-1)}+\ldots+f_2(t)y^{\prime\prime}(t)+f_1(t)y^{\prime}(t)+f_0(t)y(t)=g(t)
$$

- $f$s and $g$ are all functions of the independent variable $t$
- all terms without the dependent variable are on the right side

All $f$ functions are constants $\to$ linear ODE with constant coefficients
- independent variable represents time $\to$ called time invariant DEs

If there are no terms on the right side ($g$s) the DE is said to be homogeneous

Otherwise, the DE is called nonhomogeneous
- $g(t)$ often will be called forcing term since it will often represent a force acting upon a system

$(t-4)^2u'=2\sin(t)u$ is not in standard form
- $u' -\frac{2\sin(t)}{(t-4)^2}u=0$ is in standard form
