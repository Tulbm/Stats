DEs where the dependent variable appears "linearly"
- $y,y',y''\dots$ never appear multiplied/divided together or raised to any power other than 1
- terms including y and its derivatives may only be multiplied by constants or functions of the independent variable and added/subtracted from one another
- equations including functions of y or its derivatives are not linear ($\sin(y), e^y$)

$\frac{d^3x}{dt^3}-x\frac{dx}{dt}=\csc(t+\pi)$
- nonlinear, x is being multiplied by x'

$\frac1xu^{(4)}-u^{\prime}=-x$
- linear
