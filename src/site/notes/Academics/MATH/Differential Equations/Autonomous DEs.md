# Autonomous DEs

DEs that have the form 
$$
\frac{dy}{dx}=f(y)
$$
Functions where the rate of change of $y$ depends directly upon only $y$ itself

If any independent variables appear on the right-hand side, the DE is not autonomous

If the derivative at the equilibrium solution, $f'(a)>0 \to y=a$ is unstable, $f'(a)<0\to y=a$ is asymptotically stable
