Instead of areas like normal functions, [[Academics/MATH/Adv Calc/Multi-variable Functions\|Multi-variable Functions]] define surfaces

To be able to draw these 3d shapes in 2d, we fix one of the independent variables to get a **trace** (2D graph)
- Traces are the intersection of the surface with the plane $x\text{ (or } y)=$ constant

Level curves are the intersection of the surface with the $z=\text{constant}$ (dependent variable)
